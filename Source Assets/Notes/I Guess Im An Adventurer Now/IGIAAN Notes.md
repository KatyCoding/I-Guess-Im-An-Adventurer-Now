## Summary
I Guess I'm An Adventurer Now is an adventure RPG with roguelike elements. The player gets to build a character inspired by DND class mechanics. The game opens on the protagonist working a mundane job (different job depending on the build of character. ex: magic users will have a magic related job, fighters will have strength focused job ect.) Work will ask that the player travels to visit the farm just outside of town to pick up a package. This initiates a long drawn out quest to find the package. the game will end with the package being found. The bulk of the gameplay will revolve around tracking down where to look for the package, completing side quests, fighting monsters, and talking with characters. 
## Story  
## [[Combat and Character Abilities]]
Turn based combat similar style of play to bg3 and dnd in terms of action economy and combat interaction. For the player a combat would look visually like a paper mario fight with a slight influence of BG3. 

## Character Interaction and Dynamic Relationships
Interaction with NPC's will be dynamic based on your choices and character. similar to bg3 dialogue system, but simplified. NPC's will be colder to you if you have done things that they disagree with and vice versa.
